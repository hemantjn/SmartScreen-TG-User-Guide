The _video_ is played out on the _SmartScreen_

The **console** _pane_ on the right of the screen displays the _actions_ taken and the corresponding _status_ _codes & messages_

_P.S.: While you can see every single detail of the 'action' initiated by you on the console, every 'successful push' to SmartScreen is acknowledged with a playCenter-generated return 'ticket'_
